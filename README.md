# Binusu USSD
Crypto currency trading is a fast growing currency exchange with over 100 million users globally. Individuals can exchange fiat currency for crypto currency, buy and sell items using crypto and make investments backed by blockchain technology. Crypto Savannah through its platform Binusu Exchange (Binusu.com), offers trading in crypto currency to customers who can exchange Ugandan shilling for currencies like (CUSD, CELO, BTC, BCH, LTC & ETH). This platform is currently being accessed on smart devices and our aim is to avail it to GSM devices (feature phones) to include an untapped customer base. 

It is with this bid that the Binusu USSD application is being created to give access to Binusu.com (Uganda's oldest crypto exchange) to a wider customer base by creating a USSD gateway to the exchange. This application will enable Binusu customers connect to the Binusu Ecosystem through Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) that is supported on all GSM compliant devices.   

Through this application we hope to widen the CELO asset to access to over 100x more users not only trading in crypto but performing other functions like Deposits, Withdraws, Claims, Accounts management, remittance, merchant payments and savings for SACCOS and other community savings groups. This will drive up use of the asset and we anticipate a quarter on quarter growth of about 100%
